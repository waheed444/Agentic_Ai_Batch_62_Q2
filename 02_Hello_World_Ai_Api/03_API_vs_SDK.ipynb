        "# Difference Between API and SDK\n",
        "\n",
        "## API (Application Programming Interface)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Definition\n",
        "An **API** is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose\n",
        "- **Interaction**: APIs allow different systems or components to interact without exposing the internal details of the implementation.\n",
        "- **Integration**: APIs are primarily used to enable the integration of different systems and services.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Example\n",
        "A weather service API allows an application to request weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity) from a server.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Characteristics\n",
        "- **Minimal Interface**: Provides specific methods for interacting with a system or service.\n",
        "- **Used by Developers**: Developers use APIs to make requests and get responses.\n",
        "- **Can be accessed over a network**: APIs often operate over HTTP(S), enabling remote interactions between systems.\n",

        "## SDK (Software Development Kit)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Definition\n",
        "An **SDK** is a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, and sample code provided by a platform or service to help developers build software for a specific platform or framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose\n",
        "- **Development**: SDKs provide all the necessary resources to help developers build, test, and deploy applications.\n",
        "- **Comprehensive Toolset**: SDKs often include APIs, but also provide debugging tools, compilers, and other utilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "A mobile development SDK for iOS or Android includes APIs, UI elements, testing tools, and documentation to help developers create mobile apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Characteristics\n",
        "- **Complete Development Kit**: Includes tools, libraries, and sometimes sample code.\n",
        "- **Platform-Specific**: SDKs are often tailored to a particular platform, like Android or iOS.\n",
        "- **Build and Deploy**: SDKs are intended for the entire software development lifecycle, from development to deployment.\n",

        "## When to Use Each\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use an API** when you need to access functionality or data from another system without worrying about the underlying implementation.\n",
        "- **Use an SDK** when you are building software from scratch or need a comprehensive set of tools to develop for a specific platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "While both APIs and SDKs serve different roles, they often complement each other. An SDK typically includes APIs, along with other tools and documentation to assist developers in creating complete applications. APIs, on the other hand, are focused on providing specific functionalities to communicate between systems or services.\n"
