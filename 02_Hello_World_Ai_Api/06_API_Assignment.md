# Understanding Key API and Software Concepts

## API  
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They abstract complexity by offering a defined way to request services or data from another application.  
- **Example**: Using the `Twitter API` to fetch user tweets.

## SDK  
An **SDK (Software Development Kit)** is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation designed to help developers build software for a specific platform. SDKs simplify the development process by providing pre-built functionalities specific to the target environment.  
- **Example**: Using the `Android SDK` to develop mobile apps for Android devices.

## Web APIs  
**Web APIs** are APIs specifically designed to enable interaction between web applications and services over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. They allow applications to retrieve and manipulate data from remote servers seamlessly.  
- **Example**: Using the `Google Maps API` to display maps on a website.

## Library APIs  
**Library APIs** are interfaces provided by software libraries, allowing developers to access and utilize predefined functions or methods in their code. They reduce development time by offering reusable building blocks for common tasks.  
- **Example**: Using Python's `NumPy` library API to perform mathematical operations like `numpy.sum()`.

## Prompting and Completion  
**Prompting and Completion** involve sending input (prompt) to an AI model, which processes it and generates meaningful output (completion). This process is central to generative AI, enabling text-based or creative applications in various domains.  
- **Example**: Sending "Write a poem about the moon" to OpenAI's GPT model and receiving a poem as the output.
