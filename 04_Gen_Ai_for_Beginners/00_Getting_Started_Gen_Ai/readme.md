# What is Generative AI and LLMs?

[Watch: Introduction to Generative AI and LLMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/shows/generative-ai-for-beginners/introduction-to-generative-ai-and-llms-generative-ai-for-beginners?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

**Generative AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content—such as text, images, audio, or code—by learning patterns from existing data. These systems utilize sophisticated machine learning models, particularly deep learning algorithms, to understand and replicate the structures found in their training datasets. For example, models like OpenAI's DALL-E can generate images from textual descriptions, while ChatGPT produces human-like text responses based on input prompts. 

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are a subset of generative AI focused on processing and generating human language. Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs can perform a variety of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question-answering. They achieve this by leveraging deep learning architectures, such as transformers, to capture the nuances of language and context. Notable examples include OpenAI's GPT series and Google's BERT. 

In summary, generative AI encompasses a broad range of AI technologies capable of creating new content across various modalities, while LLMs specifically deal with understanding and generating human language, forming a crucial component of the generative AI landscape.
