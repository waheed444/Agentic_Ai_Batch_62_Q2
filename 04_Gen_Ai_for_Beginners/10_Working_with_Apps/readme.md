“Work with Apps” is a feature in OpenAI’s ChatGPT desktop app for macOS (for Windows comming soon) that allows the AI to interact directly with certain applications on your computer, enhancing its ability to provide context-aware assistance. This feature is particularly beneficial for developers, as it enables ChatGPT to access and analyze code within supported coding environments, offering more accurate and relevant responses.

How It Works:
	1.	Supported Applications: In this beta phase, “Work with Apps” is compatible with several coding tools, including:
	•	Xcode
	•	Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
	•	JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm)
	•	TextEdit
	•	Terminal and iTerm2
	2.	Enabling the Feature: To utilize this functionality:
	•	Ensure the ChatGPT macOS app is updated to the latest version.
	•	Launch one of the supported applications.
	•	In the ChatGPT app, click the “Work With Apps” button located in the chat bar and select the active application you wish to integrate.
	3.	Interaction: Once enabled, ChatGPT can access the content of open editor panes or terminal windows in the selected application. When you send a message, it includes this content as context, allowing ChatGPT to provide more tailored and precise assistance. If you highlight specific text, ChatGPT focuses on that selection while still considering the surrounding content.
	4.	Privacy and Data Handling: The content accessed from your applications becomes part of your chat history and is stored in your account until you choose to delete it. OpenAI provides data controls to manage how your information is used and stored.

Benefits:
	•	Enhanced Assistance: By accessing real-time data from your coding environment, ChatGPT can offer more relevant code suggestions, debugging help, and explanations.
	•	Streamlined Workflow: This integration reduces the need to copy and paste code between applications, allowing for a more seamless development experience.

Limitations:
	•	Read-Only Access: Currently, ChatGPT can read content from supported applications but cannot write changes directly into them. You will need to manually implement any suggestions provided.
	•	Application Support: The feature is in beta and supports a limited number of applications, primarily focused on coding tools. OpenAI plans to expand support to more applications in the future.
