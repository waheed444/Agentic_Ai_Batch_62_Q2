# Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs

NVIDIA's **Blackwell** architecture represents a significant advancement in GPU technology, tailored to meet the escalating demands of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). Unveiled in March 2024, Blackwell GPUs are engineered to deliver exceptional performance, scalability, and efficiency, positioning them as pivotal components in the progression of AI and machine learning applications.

**Key Features of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs**

- **Advanced Manufacturing Process**: Blackwell GPUs are fabricated using TSMC's custom 4NP process node, an enhancement of the 4N node utilized in previous architectures. This process incorporates additional metal layers, enabling a 30% increase in transistor count per compute die compared to the prior generation. 

- **Dual-Die Configuration**: The flagship B100 accelerator integrates two GB100 dies within a single package, connected via NVIDIA's NV-High Bandwidth Interface (NV-HBI), which offers a 10 TB/s link based on the NVLink 5.0 protocol. This design achieves full cache coherency between the dies, effectively functioning as a large monolithic GPU. 

- **Enhanced Tensor Cores**: Blackwell introduces fifth-generation Tensor Cores supporting new data types, including FP4 and FP6. The second-generation Transformer Engine facilitates quantization to these lower-precision formats, significantly boosting efficiency and throughput for generative AI training. NVIDIA claims up to 20 petaflops of FP4 compute performance for the dual-GPU GB200 superchip. 

- **Confidential Computing**: Incorporating NVIDIA Confidential Computing, Blackwell GPUs provide hardware-based security to protect sensitive data and AI models from unauthorized access. They are the first GPUs to feature TEE-I/O capabilities, ensuring secure data handling across the system. 

**Performance and Efficiency**

The Blackwell architecture delivers substantial improvements over its predecessors, offering up to 30 times more performance and 25 times greater energy efficiency. These enhancements are crucial for training large-scale AI models and executing complex HPC tasks, addressing the growing computational demands in these fields. 

**Market Adoption and Demand**

Since their introduction, Blackwell GPUs have experienced unprecedented demand, with supply reportedly sold out for the next 12 months. Major technology companies, including AWS, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle, have placed substantial orders, underscoring the industry's reliance on NVIDIA's cutting-edge hardware for AI and HPC workloads. 

**Manufacturing and Supply Chain**

To meet the high demand, NVIDIA is collaborating with TSMC to produce Blackwell AI chips at TSMC's new facility in Arizona, with production expected to commence early next year. However, certain processes, such as final packaging, will still be completed in Taiwan due to specific facility requirements. 

**Conclusion**

NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs represent a significant leap in GPU technology, offering unparalleled performance and efficiency tailored for the evolving needs of AI and HPC applications. Their advanced architecture and widespread industry adoption highlight NVIDIA's continued leadership in the GPU market, driving innovation and enabling new possibilities in computing.
